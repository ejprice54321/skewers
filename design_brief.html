							<h1>Design Brief</h1>
							<h3>The Problem</h3>
							<p> We are proposing to help people who are not engaged with their government. People are not informed about their government and it is challenging for them to find information at a level that is accessible for many people. It is time-consuming and requires a lot of organization for people to attempt to educate themselves about their government enough to vote, let alone take other civic action, like knowing if an issue is relevant to you and calling the government about it. This high entry bar leads people to feel jaded and ineffective towards their government and politics in general, thus disengaging and missing some of the points that they might be able to effect change.</p>
							<h3>The People</h3>
							<p>Our target users are college students who have an interest in government but are struggling to find the right resources to stay informed. We’re also talking to subject expert matters, such as the people behind the local government, as they are more informed about the changes.</p>
							<h3>The Thought</h3>
							<p>From a survey of 26 college students, we found that while the majority (23) feel that awareness of political issues in their voting district is relatively important, less than a fourth of them (6) actually feel informed or engaged. Almost all of them indicated social media (25) as a means of information, followed by word of mouth (16) and news aggregator apps (14). The main barriers to entry to engagement are lack of time (16) and lack of direction (13).</p>

							<p>We interviewed four respondents, as well as as a subject matter expert, to delve deeper into this issue. A common theme, again, is social media. While there are reservations about and distrust in clickbait and advertisement, social media is often used as a starting point for gathering information due to its ease of access, both in terms of its prevalence and in terms of the language it uses. Often, more credible sources like government websites use language and acronyms that are not common knowledge. As our subject matter expert stated, it takes time to build institutional knowledge. In addition, the information is not condensed enough for people who don’t have a lot time and difficult to navigate for those who are unsure of what to look for. People want relevant information that they can understand and actively engage with.</p>
							<p>Confidence in one’s ability to stay informed and engaged is another barrier to actually staying informed and engaged. Many of our interviewees equated efficacy to literacy; the more they feel that they can take action, the more informed they feel about the subject. In that same vein, the more intense their emotions regarding an issue, the more engaged they are likely to be. Proximity, physical or virtual (i.e. social media), to the problem or action also increases awareness. Below are a few images documenting our process of understanding our users and how they connect, specifically a Cultural, Venn, and Affinity Diagram.</p>

							<h3>The Requirements</h3>
							<p>Our solution must lower the barriers to entry to civic awareness and engagement. The information displayed has to be credible (supported by a variety of sources), relevant to the user (location, topic), understandable (condensed, specialized language should always be defined), and include a space for different opinions and viewpoints instead of just listing facts. It should have many of the desirable features of social media, such as being up-to-date, connecting people, and providing a starting point for further investigation, as those are the original reasons for many college students relying on social media to stay informed.</p>
							<h3>The Impact</h3>
							<p>The solution will help college students understand any updates going on in their local government. This solution should also empower them to take civic action where reasonable. It will increase their confidence in their ability to stay informed about current events, seek out their own credible resources, and engage with the government in matters that they are invested in. The solution should also work with corresponding experts to make sure information is presented in a colloquial way, depending on the topic at hand.</p>
							<h3>The Considerations</h3>
							<p>Defining a usable system for such a broad group of people (college students) is challenge. Not every student has the same educational background and emphasis on staying informed. Our interviews with our four respondents helped us see how their backgrounds influence their view on civic engagement. Although we found some commonalities in all of our users, we will be careful when making generalizations about what works for this user group.</p>
							<p>For further research, we would want to interact with more subject matter experts to determine in what ways this problem is currently being solved, especially for college students. The chair of the board of selectman that we talked to dealt mostly with other experts in the field and older adults who are often already informed and involved with civics and current events. In addition, our interviews were all with women; we would want to get more gender balance to fully represent are target users.</p>
