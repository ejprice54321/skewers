							<h3>Purpose</h3>
							<p>We are undergraduate engineering students at Olin College of Engineering, currently enrolled in a course called User Experience Design (UXD). As such, we hope to gain insight into designing user interfaces (UIs) through feedback and interactions with potential users. This will help us to design software solutions that address real concerns.</p>
							<h3>Description</h3>
							<p>For this purpose, we would like to speak with you to understand the ways you currently use technology, your preferences and annoyances in daily software interactions, and what you might like to see going forward. The interview will consist of a conversation and a number of questions; we may also request that you interact with a prototype we will provide, observe your behavior with it, and inquire into the experience afterwards in order to improve it for the future. All activities are entirely optional, and at any point you are free to end the interview. Our priority is to use your feedback to improve our project.</p>
							<h3>Techniques that May be Used</h3>
							<p>All techniques are subject to your approval. Agreeing to one data collection technique (i.e. an interview) does not imply approval to any other technique (i.e. photos). We will ask before employing any of these.
							<ul>
								<li>Interviews</li>
								<li>Photos</li>
								<li>Voice/video recording</li>
								<li>Demonstration Documentation</li>
							</ul></p>
							<h3>Time</h3>
							<p>We will strive to take up no more of your time than is necessary. An interview may last from 30 minutes to an hour. Should you require us to leave early at any time, we will immediately comply. As this project spans the course of a semester, we may request subsequent meetings at a later time. Agreeing to one interview does not obligate you to participate in any of the following interviews.</p>
							<h3>Confidentiality</h3>
							<p>Your confidentiality is a priority. All information will be anonymized to the best of our ability. For this purpose, we will not use your real name in recordings, use pseudonyms in our records, and ensure that your contact information is kept secure and known only to our team. Sensitive information will not be shared beyond the interviewer. Should you agree to participate in the interview, you may decline to answer any question, prompt, or activity, as well as end the interview whenever you desire.</p>
							<h3>Compensation</h3>
							<p>We are unable to offer monetary compensation for your time. We hope that speaking with us may bring you indirect benefits, such as learning about the design process, our class, and seeing your feedback implemented through iterations of the project; however, we acknowledge that we will be the primary beneficiaries, as your feedback will help us improve and learn.</p>
