							<h1>Formal usability Study</h1>

							<h2>Identify some specific question that would be helpful in your design and for which a formal study might be appropriate.</h2>

							<ol>
							<li>We recently changed our settings screen based on feedback from Jordyn Burger and Matt Beaudouin. One settings page has a simple advanced page that then goes into an advanced settings with whitelists and blacklists topics and settings. The other settings page has only the simple settings page, laid out in list format. Both the advanced page on the first settings and the main page on the second settings allow users to change the order of  their topic preference.</li>
							<li>We want to test how long (time) does it take users to make homelessness a topic that is more important/relevant than animals, but less important than taxes?</li> 
							<li>How would you ensure that taxes is the most important/relevant topic to you?</li>
							</ol>

							<h2>Write up your experiment design and post it on your site before class by the time designated on the Final Refinement Phase Checklist. Your writeup can be a page or less, but it should clearly spell out the logic of your experimental design:</h2>

							<p><i>None of us have prior experience with controlled experiments.</i></p>

							<p><b>Explain the hypothesis that your formal study would allow you to test.</b></p>
							<p>Presence of an Advanced Settings option will impact users experience when arranging their topic preferences.</p>

							<p><b>Describe the factor(s) (independent variable(s)) that you will vary:</b></p>
							<p>Our formal study will include two experimental conditions. One where users do have the advanced settings option and one where the users do not. Aspects of the application, such as the initial preferences and location are the same for each user. Throughout the test, we will be collecting thoughts about these questions:</p>
							<ol>
							<li>What do you expect to see in the settings page, given our directions?</li>
							<li>Now that you have seen the first settings page, what do you expect to be able to personalize?</li>
							<li>Now that you have seen the second settings page, what do you expect to be able to personalize?</li>
							<li>What other settings might you expect to be able to personalize?</li>
							</ol>

							<p><b>What dependent (response) variable(s) will you observe?</b></p>
							<p>We will observe and record the number of confusions or concerns the users bring up, as well as the amount of time it takes for users to complete the task of reordering topics in each condition.</p>

							<p><b>If your hypothesis is correct, what pattern would you expect to observe in the response variables?</b></p>
							<p>If our hypothesis is correct, we would also expect users to mention fewer confusions or concerns. We would also expect users to take a shorter amount of time to reorder a topic for the first time.</p>

							<p><b>Also explain how many subjects you would ideally test, how many iterations each would participate in, and if each participant tries multiple conditions, how these conditions would be ordered and distributed over participants.</b></p>
							<p>Ideally, we would want to test at least twenty subjects with varying degrees technological literacy. Each user would participate in both conditions, with half starting with the simple settings option and the other half starting with the advanced settings option.</p>
