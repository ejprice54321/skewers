							<h1>Formal usability Study</h1>

							<h2>Identify some specific question that would be helpful in your design and for which a formal study might be appropriate.</h2>

							<ol>
							<li>We recently changed our settings screen based on feedback from Jordyn Burger and Matt Beaudouin. One settings page has a simple advanced page that then goes into an advanced settings with whitelists and blacklists topics and settings. The other settings page has only the simple settings page, laid out in list format. Both the advanced page on the first settings and the main page on the second settings allow users to change the order of  their topic preference.</li>
							<li>We want to test how long (time) does it take users to make homelessness a topic that is more important/relevant than animals, but less important than taxes?</li> 
							<li>How would you ensure that taxes is the most important/relevant topic to you?</li>
							</ol>

							<h2>Write up your experiment design and post it on your site before class by the time designated on the Final Refinement Phase Checklist. Your writeup can be a page or less, but it should clearly spell out the logic of your experimental design:</h2>

							<p><i>None of us have prior experience with controlled experiments.</i></p>

							<p><b>Explain the hypothesis that your formal study would allow you to test.</b></p>
							<p>Presence of an Advanced Settings option will impact users experience when arranging their topic preferences.</p>

							<p><b>Describe the factor(s) (independent variable(s)) that you will vary:</b></p>
							<p>Our formal study will include two experimental conditions. One where users do have the advanced settings option and one where the users do not. Aspects of the application, such as the initial preferences and location are the same for each user. Throughout the test, we will be collecting thoughts about these questions:</p>
							<ol>
							<li>What do you expect to see in the settings page, given our directions?</li>
							<li>Now that you have seen the first settings page, what do you expect to be able to personalize?</li>
							<li>Now that you have seen the second settings page, what do you expect to be able to personalize?</li>
							<li>What other settings might you expect to be able to personalize?</li>
							</ol>

							<p><b>What dependent (response) variable(s) will you observe?</b></p>
							<p>We will observe and record the number of confusions or concerns the users bring up, as well as the amount of time it takes for users to complete the task of reordering topics in each condition.</p>

							<p><b>If your hypothesis is correct, what pattern would you expect to observe in the response variables?</b></p>
							<p>If our hypothesis is correct, we would also expect users to mention fewer confusions or concerns. We would also expect users to take a shorter amount of time to reorder a topic for the first time.</p>

							<p><b>Also explain how many subjects you would ideally test, how many iterations each would participate in, and if each participant tries multiple conditions, how these conditions would be ordered and distributed over participants.</b></p>
							<p>Ideally, we would want to test at least twenty subjects with varying degrees technological literacy. Each user would participate in both conditions, with half starting with the simple settings option and the other half starting with the advanced settings option.</p>


							<h2>Report</h2>
							<p><b>General Overview</b></p>

							<p>We conducted formal usability testing on three users, followed by informal testing with each of these users. One user interacted with the simple settings page before interacting with the advanced settings page, while the other two interacted with the advanced settings page first.</p>

							<p>Overall, the advanced settings page seemed to be more popular with users despite raising more questions and concerns. The concerns for the simple settings page, however, were generally more severe in the sense that users were asking for personalization not currently included as opposed to clarification about a feature. For example, when viewing the simple settings page, users expected to be able to blacklist topics as well as edit sources, which are functions included in the advanced settings page. In contrast, one common question after viewing the advanced settings page was what “whitelist” means. In addition, most of the concerns for the advanced settings page also applied to the simple settings page. This included being able to adjust granularity of topics (e.g. show taxes but not Trump-related taxes), see suggestions for topics (based on popularity or similar users), and setting political affiliation. We can thus tentatively conclude that the advanced settings page seems to align more closely with user expectations, contrary to our hypothesis.</p>

							<p><b>Interpretation</b></p>
							
							<p>If these results held with a larger user population, we can conclude our current advanced settings page aligns more closely with user expectations, given some moderate changes. In particular, blacklisting and whitelisting topics and sources is something users want from a settings page, reflected by our advanced settings option, although “preferred” topics and sources seems to be a more universally understood term than “whitelisted” topics and sources. Furthermore, if the trend continues to hold, we may want to expand our (advanced) settings page to include more adjustable features such as setting political affiliation and adjusting granularity of topics. Overall, while users do not want complete control of what they see on their feed, they want the option to control the filters behind what they see.</p>

							<p><b>Explanation</b></p>

							<p>In response to both our formal and informal usability testing, we moved back to our advanced settings page, in which users are able to filter both topics and sources they want to see and don’t want to see. All the users we asked wanted to be able to blacklist topics and sources instead of just adjusting preferred topics. However, there are some changes in place. First, instead of “whitelisted” topics or sources, users can now adjust “preferred” topics or sources. This change reflects the confusion many users had about the meaning of “whitelisting”.</p>

							<p>In addition, our original advanced settings option contained two pages: the first only allowed users to change location and add or remove topics; users had to go to the second “advanced” page to rank, add, or remove preferred or blacklisted items. This ended up confusing and really frustrating at least two users because it took them a while to realize there was a second page, and they were further confused by the fact that the actions on the first page could also be done on the second page. As a result, we combined both pages into one.</p>

							<p>Finally, we adopted the single column layout from our basic settings prototype into our advanced settings page. For all of our users, having a widescreen column of items, each with a set of dots on the side, was more intuitive to drag and rank than an unjustified list of items with no dots, which was what we originally had in our advanced settings page.</p>

							<p>With more time, we intend to test out further adjustable options in the settings page, including but not limited to setting political affiliation, adjusting granularity of topics, filtering by date, and having a list of suggested topics to choose from to add into preferred settings. Some ideas seem to be common across users and may be helpful to include, although further testing would be required to test whether users would actually want them when presented with an interactive prototype.</p>
