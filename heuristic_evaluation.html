							<h1>Team Ice Cream Scoop: A Heuristic Evaluation</h1>
							<h2>Mary, Ilya, and Bill</h2>

							<h2>Overall Evaluation</h2>

							<p>Overall, we like your consistent aesthetic and readable design.</p>

							<p>We like that you list the topics and sources you’ve selected on the Settings page -- it helps with recognition vs recall; the user doesn’t need to know if they’re already subscribed to The Swellesely Report; they can just check. We like that you offer the user the chance to both input an address or pick the district on the map. We like that you’re using icons to help identify what topic a specific article refers to -- it helps the user immediately understand why it’s relevant and it simplifies the look of the Feed (instead of article pictures).</p>

							<p>However, there are a few details that can be tweaked to make your app more intuitive and user-friendly.</p>

							<p>Look at following IOS and Android navigation/style conventions more closely. For example, your Share menu with the logos is an excellent execution of something that is intuitive and familiar to users. Being more consistent with the options you provide to users (like whether they hit a save changes button to save changes or do something else) between screens and more cognizant of accessibility (ex. you might want to think about changing your colors for the map since they’re bad for color blind people or adding texture like shading to the states to help them differentiate) will make this app easier to navigate for users.</p>

							<h2>Issues with the Heuristic</h2>
							<p>Here is the union of the sets of the heuristic issues we noticed as a team:</p>

							<ol>

							<li><b>[H3 User Control and Freedom] (severity 3) -- 3 of us</b><br>
							When you hover over the first marijuana article without clicking for a few seconds, there’s automatically a popup that asks if you want to see more articles like it, etc, which is frustrating when you’re just trying to look around without committing to any action.</li>

							<li><b>[H6, Recognition rather than Recall] (severity 3) -- 1 of us</b><br>
							It may be very personal to me, but when I first encounter the Your Feed page after filling out my “profile” - I am confused. I feel an instinct to want to go back to the “Home” screen with the map. I think there is a disorienting feeling the setup process creates where I am unsure of the purpose or goals I am trying to achieve. Perhaps starting on the Your Feed page and having the key Create Profile function available will help with this lack of clarity?</li>

							<li><b>[H4, Consistency and Standards] (severity 3) -- 1 of us</b><br>
							When you choose to delete and show less articles about marijuana, the topic “marijuana” is still in the user profile. I think you need to figure out either a way to inform the user that the app will delete marijuana from the profile, or a way for the users to have marijuana articles back without deleting and re-adding marijuana to their profile.</li>


							<li><b>[H3 User Control and Freedom / H4 Consistency and Standards] (severity 3) -- 1 of us</b><br>
							There’s no back button option on the Location page when you zoom out to the big map -- if the user decides they actually don’t want to make any changes, there’s no way for them to undo the zoom-out.</li>

							<li><b>[H2 Visibility of System Status / H7 Flexibility and Efficiency of Use]  (severity 2) -- 3 of us found this</b><br>
							When you click “Use current location” on the state-size map, there is an indication of the voting district being selected but no status update of “done” or “move onto next page”. Although minor, I would suggest shortening that transition or making it more explicit.<br>
							When you hit “Use Current Location” from the zoomed out map screen, you have to click it again when it zooms in on the state to actually select your current district -- that’s an action you should be able to do in 1-click.</li>

							<li><b>[H3, Aesthetic and minimalist design] (severity 2) -- 1 of us</b><br>
							It’s confusing in choosing interests that the “other option” of Homelessness appears above an unchosen option. It’s unexpected in a bad way. I feel like anything new that is added to the screen should follow conventions of being added to the bottom of the current list.</li>

							<li><b>[H4, Consistency and Standards] (severity 2) -- 1 of us</b><br>
							I’m not clear on the need for separating the “Other” options into Primary Sources, Local News and Social Media. I’m just thinking of what I am interested in, not what type of source that is. A single “Other” button at the bottom of the screen would minimize the amount of information displayed and improve clarity for the user.</li>

							<li><b>[H3 User Control and Freedom] (severity 2) -- 1 of us</b><br>
							The top bar doesn’t float during scrolling, which is annoying if you scroll 100 articles down then decide you want to change a setting.</li>

							<li><b>[H6 Recognition over Recall] (severity 2) -- 1 of us</b><br>
							On the “Create Your Profile” topics search page, you have to know issues to search for; ranking issues from most popular to least popular in a scrollable list would use more recognition instead of requiring that the user think of everything they’re interested in on the spot (ie I might not think of women’s health but I do care about it).</li>

							<li><b>[H4 Consistency and Standards] (severity 2) -- 2 of us</b><br>
							On, the “Create Your Profile” news sources page, the “Other *” buttons look very similar to the actual new source options -- the only difference is color, which may be difficult for colorblind people to differentiate, and it generally just looks like options I haven’t selected yet, not something that will have a “see more” kind of action if selected.</li>

							<li><b>[H4, Consistency and Standards] (severity 2) -- 1 of us</b><br>
							When adding resources that I trust (Natick Bulletin and Tab), I spent a little time thinking about which resource category it belongs and locating that input box. I think it is better just having one input box and put whatever the user enters in the correct category automatically, instead of letting the user think about category.</li>

							<li><b>[H1 Flexibility and Efficiency of Use & H4 Consistency and Standards] (severity 2) -- 1 of us</b><br>
							The first time you’re creating a user profile, some user would prefer a “skip for later” option when selecting resources and topics. The current next button could be replaced by a “Save” button so the user can get a better sense of what the system is doing.</li>

							<li><b>[H2 Visibility of System Status] (severity 2) -- 1 of us</b><br>
							When highlighting boxes to pick topics of interest, the option present to continue is a bottom right side arrow. It seems like an “Enter” or “Save” button makes more sense here because the information you are entering is affecting your experience with the app and is something you may want to edit later. When you move on by clicking next, it is unclear what the system’s response to your information is, or if you will have access to it in the future.</li>

							<li><b>[H3 User Control and Freedom] (severity 2) -- 2 of us</b><br>
							The popup asking if you want to see more articles like whichever one you were hovering over doesn’t give you the option to cancel -- it forces you to decide if you want more of it, less of it, or to delete it when you might just want no changes.</li>

							<li><b>[H3 User Control and Freedom / H4 Consistency and Standards] (severity 2) -- 1 of us</b><br>
							There’s no option to save changes made to your location (just a back button), which is inconsistent with the Settings page’s option to save changes and misleading, because clicking a back button without saving changes implies changes will not be saved.</li>

							<li><b>[H6 Recognition over Recall] (severity 2) -- 1 of us</b><br>
							The share and “leave” icons at the top of the article page both look like typical share icons. It’s not clear to the user that the “leave” icon will jump them to a new page and they’ll have to remember to not confuse them while using the app (having a popup asking “are you sure you want to leave?” might help with this).</li>

							<li><b>[H6 Recognition rather than recall] (severity 1) -- 1 of us</b><br>
							Most users are used to “Current Location” being a known by their GPS-enabled cell phones. When showing that as an option, it would make more sense to have a location pin be dropped on their approximate location instead of having the icon by the words themselves.</li>

							<li><b>[H3 User Control and Freedom] (severity 1) -- 1 of us</b><br>
							There’s an option to “Save Changes” when you remove marijuana from the list of topics you’re interested in but when you hit the back button without saving the changes (which isn’t implemented), it shows a feed updated with the change (so the back button doesn’t undo changes) -- having the back button and “Save Changes” button makes you think hitting back without saving won’t save any of the changes you made.</li>

							<li><b>[H4 Consistency and Standards] (severity 1) -- 1 of us</b><br>
							The keyboard cannot be currently used when filling out “other” for desired topics of interest or sources. I’m guessing this is a Figma functionality piece, but having the users type a random letter and h automatically comes up for homelessness is an interesting experience for sure.</li>

							<li><b>[H4 Consistency and Standards] (severity 0) -- 1 of us</b><br>
							The hashtags are inconsistently spaced.</li>

							</ol>

							<h2>Recommendations</h2>
							<ul>

							<li>The Your Feed screen made me think about a way you could improve flow even more. Instead of just filtering topics under Settings, you could allow users to swipe Right/Left (kind of like Tinder) in identifying articles in their feed they are interested/don’t care about.</li>

							<li>Add a “save changes” option to changing location to be consistent with the editing workflow for topics/sources.</li>

							<li>Give the user the option to “skip for now” when they first use the app so they don’t have to immediately pick sources and interests -- this would relieve some pressure on the user to decide on the spot what they care about and who they trust.</li>

							<li>When a user clicks “use current location” from the zoomed-out map, transition to the frame with the selected district -- this is a more intuitive result than going to the state map.</li>

							</ul>
